## A little advice for you ❗❗❗
<hr>

<p> I usually use "Prettier" to improve my code and make it look cleaner. It is also super useful for those who are starting to program. I know that when we are beginners in writing code, we usually make mistakes or our code looks messier and we can't read it ourselves. </p>

 `Prettier` <p> offers support for multiple languages and frameworks. What `Prettier` offers is to take your code and "re-format" it based on the defined settings thus maintaining a consistent style. Making it much more readable and without worrying about how you write it initially.</p>
